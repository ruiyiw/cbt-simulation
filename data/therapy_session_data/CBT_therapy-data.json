I don't know that there is a literature to prove this, but I literally wrote the book on foster care and adoption about the therapy they are in. I've done this a lot and I can tell you I met with a neurologist one time who was working with akid and he said, 'If I see someone is adopted I just assume they have either bi-polar disorder or ADD.' And here is why: because in our society it is not reinforced to give children up for adoption. It's looked down upon. So if you decide not to have a child, you have an abortion - that's whya third of those teen pregnancies end in abortion - or you keep the child. [00:12:59] Rarely do people give children up for adoption. This is why there are so few children to adopt. The people who tend to do that tend to be people with ADD or bi-polar disorder because they can't, they just can't.It's easier for them. I think that's why the signal went on for me, so we have to be thinking about biological issues here, as well as behavioral issues. You're describing some family history and there is an old thing called a genogram that people used to sit down and do and build this giant chart ofthe family. That's super interesting and really expensive and tedious. If you would like to do that, that might be fascinating; but I don't know that we even have enough data. I'm a little concerned that you're starting to see some of that because this is the age where that urge is. Your explosivenessis not fully consistent with ADD. [00:14:00] Let me be clear, Kevin, I'm not just throwing you under the bus here. I understand that we need to make changes in the whole system, but we also have to understand sort of what goes on with your brain chemistry beyond what you may be aware of."

I was going to give you this example anyhow, but it's funny that you mentioned it that way. Many years ago I had this girl come in whowas referred by the doctor because of low weight. That really wasn't the problem. The problem was she had, not only ADD, but anxiety and, to be honest with you, she wasn't very smart. We did all this testing on her and I had to sit her down one day and say, 'You're not very smart,' which was a veryhard thing to say. [00:30:05] She said, 'I know that. I'm aware of that.' I said, 'Thankfully, you're very sweet and a good person.' Recently I went to her wedding and just before that I went to her college graduation, which is a real school. She took seven years, but she got through college with aBachelor's degree and then - I'm going to change this a little to protect her confidentiality - let's say it was in nursing. Then she had to pass this exam and it took her three tries. It was just horrible. Every time she would take it she would fail. She would be in here sobbing that itwas horrible. The last time she was like, 'I'm not going to take it again.' I said, 'Yeah, you are. You sure are.' 'Why? You just want to make me suffer.' [00:31:02] I said, 'No. It's because you've come as far as you did.' And then one day I get a text that she passed it. She didn't tell anybody shewas going to take it again, she just went and did it and passed it. So here is this person - and she has a good job now; she does really important work. So what do you suppose this person who has an 87 IQ, [under it is average] (ph?), ADD and anxiety, how do you suppose she ever did this? I'llgive it to you again. There was no cheating involved. What do you suppose allowed her to do this?"

I want to be clear - in no way am I suggesting they punish you for not having homework.

So your mom can find [ ] (inaudible at 00:35:59) school that provides some additional work for you to do.

I'm going to give you [ ] (inaudible at 00:36:18) on this; talk to the teachers and anything that he can turn in by e-mail, you guys need to switch over to e-mail.

They don't want to do it so they'll do any accommodation you want if they don't have to put it down and have him sign off on it; so try to get everything turned in by e-mail that you can get.

We're your insurance company and you have a co-pay. You will have to pay the co-pay and we will cover the rest of it.' He was taking this intoaccount; and he was nine at the time.

Some critic in New York wrote how terrible the concert wasand Harry Truman (laughing) wrote this horrible letter. Of course, I think he actually sent it to the New York Times and it was terrible.

You hear how hesitant I am because I think that is such an invasion of your privacy, but you are kind of beggingfor it; and so my recommendation is that they give you two more weeks and you're supposed to be self-regulating. I don't think they ought to start up any arguments with you about study time. That's what they should not do. If you don't do it, you don't do it; and then we reconvene here and if you'renot able to manage your own study time, then we're going to put the nuclear trigger on that phone.

I use this example on the radio (chuckles) because half of my radio shows, my mom is with me in the green room because we're going to an eye appointment. I schedule those on the same day, and so I have commented a time or two that I know my mom is listening to the show, right now.(laughs) And being cognizant of that is helpful for me in thinking about the little old ladies listening to me or whatever. We do some pretty heavy-duty content so some days that's a little bit uncomfortable.

Oh, God. I felt happy about that. You don't really want to put anything up on Facebook you don't want your granny to read. And that's notjust because you're respecting adults, it's because anything your granny can't read probably shouldn't be published in your online newspaper.

Those kids will say some amazingly great things and the next thing they'll say is some weird reference to cocaine that even I don't understand and you're just thinking 'oh, God, no.' [00:49:02]"

He hadquite a bit to say about that very issue and he said, 'I don't recommend anybody post anything they don't want an employer to see.' He said they're selling that information as part of the data vetting process, too. He had a lot more knowledge about this than I do. It's all public information. Facebookowns all that. They can keep it and there are laws they're trying to write in California that adults can expunge all of their crapola they put up as minors. And they are running into just tremendous problems implementing this law. [00:49:59] It's called the scrub the web law. They're trying to evenrespond to this because kids have such a tendency to do themselves in. I don't care if you all do a Facebook, that's an interesting concern you have, but if you do a Facebook you need to come to some peace about it together and agree on what the rules are going to be. When one girl was on there, she'smoved all the way to college, she said that as soon as she's an adult, she's going to defriend her family. (chuckles) But she says, 'I understand to this point why they felt they needed to be on there.' I disagreed with her about that. I thought when you're in college if you don't want your parent tosee something you ought not to probably be doing it and not posting it, but I understand. I respect the adult in her to differentiate. I don't know what she decided to do on that, but you have a lot of media issues, man. I'm going to tell you that in the next two weeks you get in charge of your mediaissues or I'll love you enough to crush you to death. [00:51:02] How's that? Fair enough? I'm pretty tech [oriented] (ph?) How's that? Do you want to know what teenagers think about? You just get on Twitter. You just get on Twitter and you will know what teenagers think about because they don't spendon second between here and Tweeting. It comes right out. It is the most powerful ethnography of adolescence in America today. I have learned so much and it gives me material to sort of talk with kids about things I'm not thinking is on their minds, and it absolutely is. It's really interesting.

Get him up to the right dose of medicine and these things go away, then what we will have learned is that they are a product of indeliberative thinking; he isn't thinking thingsthrough before he does them. And so then he thinks them through and he thinks, 'Oh, man. I want to drive the Rover really bad, but I probably shouldn't. I'm going to get in trouble.' That's going to be one scenario. (chuckles) The other scenario would be he gets worse and then we're going to have tostart looking at some different issues. If he doesn't get any better and he doesn't get any better with the anger thing, then we're going to puzzle over that a little bit more because it may just be oppositional defiance. [01:02:10] I tend to go to that last because it's sort of unproductive behaviorfor a teenager so it's usually driven by something else. But if that's it, then we're just going to have to go into lots of consequences. The worst part of the consequences for the oppositional people is you always look for the ones that are the most annoying. That doesn't sound very fun, does it? Soyou're going to do a couple of weeks. And the other thing I'm trying to figure out, Kevin, how often are you having your break time where you cool yourself off. I think that's a nice thing, but that should be about a tenor a 15-minute process; and if it's two and three hours, that seems like you'resketchy to me. [01:03:07] That's just the thought. I want to hear what it is you're angry about, what's triggering you and how you're handling it."

And even being angry isn't unusual in these situations, especially at your age, where you're kind of learning and growing, but the more you lay around and thinkabout things during the day, the more depressed you're going to get. It's okay, you're going to have that happen periodically because the dog was close to you and it's going to come back to you periodically in the next few days, and if your main coping is to sit around and get depressed, you're goingto have a longer recovery time.

One of the things we've done is reallylearn to read not only the medication flow of the day, which for him, it's a little better, but also just sort of the ebbs and flows. Like coming home after school, depending on the point in the semester, but when medicine is toward the end of its cycle, they're in much better moods, but when it's reallywhere it belongs, they're just not in very good moods. They are like Kevin after the long day of swimming and talking and being with people and doing all that stuff. My kids are done with having to think and having to interact with people, and so if I want to talk about, on the way home from school,oh you know, how did choir go today, I'm going to get one or two responses; I don't want to talk about it or it was horrible, the girls didn't sing and they're so annoying and just, I hate them, I hate them all. Well, okay, so I'm just going to get what I bargained for. And so if we head down any ofthose paths, I'm usually like, good time for quiet time. My kids have learned to self-disclose that, so they'll be just like, I don't want to talk about it, I just want to read. And then that's the time to shut up, that's the time to really think, they're communicating with me. Even if it's alittle harsh, they're really saying to me, we need to be down. The place it gets dicey, which I am sure is true with you and Jessica, is not infrequently, one of them is interested in talking, particularly Evan, my son, and he always wants to do one of our stories together, where we tell a story toeach other, and that, Penny is so sick of that. Even if it's a new story we make up together, she just hates it. This morning she was like, she told us this is the week before their concert and the whole week, we can't tell stories to each other because it will distract her and upset her too much. Iseriously was like, I just want you to walk to school, but I just shut up. I thought, she's trying to tell me a way to interact with her and it's probably better just to roll with it. So, see if you can sort of observe some of those, see if you can be - I don't want you to learn to communicatewith them like Penny does with me, try to do better than that, but the more you can sort of read, when is his weak spot, how do I find a better time to interact. These are the same tools. This isn't sort of like catering to him. It's exactly the same tools we teach couples on how to interact with eachother, how to pick a time to talk about a conflictual subject, how to do what we call soft start, which is to say listen, there's something I want to talk to you about, is this a good time? It has to do with the dishwasher, you know couples fight about the credit cards, and try to start it up in reallya very intentional calm fashion. That would be good things for you to work on this next week. I think you guys get an A-plus. Way to go. [00:51:16]"

So, let'stalk about that explicitly next time, and try and not have any crises between now and then, so we can have a really intelligent conversation of your phone, because the more you don't have crises, the more intelligent our conversations become. Have you noticed how that works? Like, I haven't threatenedyou once this week, have you noticed that, isn't it great? So that really helps, because it elevates the discussion to be about things that are going to be really relevant to you. That's why I was asking you about girls, because that's going to be a big issue as you're moving through middle school,and nowhere will that become more relevant than in the use of your electronic devices. Love, sex and electronics all go together like this right now, like a tight little band. It makes breaking up harder, there's all sorts of methods of transmitting your various private parts around the Internet, there'sjust a ton of stuff.
